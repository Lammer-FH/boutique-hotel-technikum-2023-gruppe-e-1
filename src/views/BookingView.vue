    <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the
    collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
    control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
    modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It is also worth noting
    that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
    does limit overflow.
